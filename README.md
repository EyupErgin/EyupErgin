Hello, my name is Eyüp Şükrü Ergin. As you can tell from my name, I am a dedicated Intelligence Analyst, Threat Researcher, and Threat Hunter committed to unraveling the mysteries of the complex world. I specialize in the fields of Cybersecurity and Cyber Intelligence, conducting extensive research and analysis. I have valuable experience of approximately 3 years in the field of cybersecurity and have been continuously developing myself for 5 years.
<br><br>
I particularly focus on Threat Hunting and Threat Research, especially on Cyber ​​Threat Intelligence. Among the tasks I lead as a project leader, I engage in analyzing Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups, malware, and network activities, with a common focus on Command and Control (C&C) servers. I meticulously work on the analysis and detection of Command and Control servers and model attacks. Additionally, I concentrate on project capable of automating the detection and analysis processes of malicious software, aiming to minimize the impact of cyber threats and develop more proactive cybersecurity solutions in the companies I work with.

I prefer my main system BlackArch Linux as the software languages I use for the development environment and the operating system. In addition, while I meet all my Cyber Security and Software needs in this operating system, I prefer Python, GoLang and C to develop my programs and use them in my projects.
